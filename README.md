# Welcome to Johnosoft

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to Johnosoft — a personal homelab initiative and digital playground where I build, self-host, and maintain a variety of web services for my friends and family.

This project is more than just infrastructure — it’s a growing archive of knowledge, documenting everything I’ve learned while running services at home. You’ll find step-by-step guides, daily technical discoveries, and thoughts on the journey of becoming more self-reliant in the digital world.

If you’re curious about self-hosting, building resilient networks, or just enjoy tinkering with tech, you’re in the right place.

## 🛠️ Hosted Services
Here’s a quick overview of the systems and services currently running on my homelab:

```yaml
system:
  - proxmox: 3 nodes
  - truenas: 2 nodes
network:
  - wireguard: VPN
  - pi-hole: DNS
services:
  - ollama: personal AI service
  - vaultwarden: password manager
  - mailcow: email service
  - nextcloud: cloud storage and office
  - jellyfin: media library and service
  - kasm: personal laboratory
documents:
  - mk-docs: blogs and documentations
```
Everything is containerized, secured, and continuously evolving — and I document the process as I go.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
How-to Guides — Step-by-step tutorials and setups, from bare-metal provisioning to app deployment.

Daily Learnings — Notes and reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently.

Behind the Scenes — Deep dives into system design, architecture choices, and lessons from real-world issues.
