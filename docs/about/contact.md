# 📬 Get in Touch

Whether you’re here to swap homelab tips, geek out about Proxmox setups, ask a question, or just say hi — I’d love to hear from you.

## ✉️ Email  
Got a thought, a bug report, or a recommendation for an obscure command-line tool I’ve never heard of?

Shoot me a message at:  
**[john@johnosoft.org](mailto:john@johnosoft.org)**

I check this inbox with the same enthusiasm I reserve for blinking LEDs on a fresh server boot — so expect a reply, unless I’m trapped debugging something at 2 AM.
