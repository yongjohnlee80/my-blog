# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m John — a lifelong enthusiast of computing and software development.

My passion ignited at the age of 9, when I first encountered a BASIC animation of a stick figure pushing a box. I was so captivated that I memorized the entire script on the spot, despite barely knowing any English. That spark led me to enroll in a computer cram school in Korea, where I dove into BASIC and soon started crafting my own simple games. By grade six, I had earned a spot on the honor roll of the **National Personal Computer Competition** (전국 퍼스널컴퓨터 경진대회), proudly competing among the adults with Turbo C 2.0, dBase III, and Lotus 1-2-3.

Facing the 64‑tile limit of animation on a IBM 286 AT with BASIC pushed me to teach myself C and C++. When my family moved to Canada, I tested directly into Computer Science 12 as a grade-nine student which I aced it. In the following year (June 1996), I earned another honor‑roll nod in the **Canadian Computing Competition**, writing algorithms in Borland C++ 3.11 as one of the youngest in the province.

Although life steered me into other ventures through my 20s and 30s, the passion never faded. At 40, I returned full force to computing—working days as I pursued my Computer Science degree by night. Today, I’m a full‑time software engineer doing what I love: **building software and solving problems through code**.

This blog is my digital workshop and journal. Here, I share step‑by‑step guides, daily discoveries, and reflections from my work and homelab experiments. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
