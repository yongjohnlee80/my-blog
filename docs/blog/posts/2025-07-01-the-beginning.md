# 🚀 This is the Beginning of My Post

It finally happened. After years of dreaming about having my own little corner of the internet to document my homelab adventures, rants, discoveries, and occasional tech mishaps — **Johnosoft is live**.

And honestly? I thought this was going to be a weekend of pain, duct tape, and digital grease. But nope — building this site with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) was *weirdly* smooth. Like, suspiciously smooth. Like… *“is this a trap?”* kind of smooth.

## 🧱 Zero to Site in... Not That Long

I started out just wanting a place to jot down my notes: things I learn while hosting services like Vaultwarden, Mailcow, Nextcloud, etc., so I don’t have to keep digging through my shell history to remember how I reverse-proxied something six months ago. You know the drill.

After testing a few static site generators, **MkDocs + Material theme** stood out like a glowing green LED on an old IBM AT motherboard.

- It’s Markdown-based ✅  
- The theme is gorgeous out of the box ✅  
- Built-in search that actually works ✅  
- Deploys like a breeze ✅  
- Has dark mode (essential for night owls like me) ✅  

The whole experience felt like putting LEGO together with instructions *and* extra pieces.

## ⚙️ I Didn't Even Break Anything (Yet)

I initialized a repo, installed MkDocs with `pip`, ran `mkdocs serve`, and *bam* — there it was. My site. Running. With live reload. On localhost. As if it had always been there, just waiting for me to discover it.

I didn’t even need to scream into the void or sacrifice a goat to the YAML gods.

Though let’s be honest… it’s only a matter of time before I `git push -f` into oblivion. But that’s future John’s problem.

## 🧪 What’s Next?

- I’ll be writing **how-to guides** for setting up services on my homelab.
- Sharing **lessons learned** when things break (because they *will*).
- And sometimes, just rambling about why I love computing so much.

Whether you’re a fellow self-hoster, a curious lurker, or one of my kids checking to see if Dad’s famous yet — welcome.

This is just the beginning. And I’m genuinely excited to see where it goes.

Thanks for reading. Now excuse me while I go over-engineer a backup system for my static site. Because… priorities. 😅
